# Weather-Dashboard
- This is a little demo project intended to show some of what I'm capable of in terms of building React applications
- The anticipated user for the application is an event planner who is responsible for planning something on a weekly basis, as the app gives the user visual weather insights for a a specified location and day of the week, with the ability to traverse by week in both directions
- The app is fully responsive to mobile formats and changes in screen dimensions
- To see the dashboard in action, visit this code sandbox link and run the preview https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/peaceful-sara-pdrnmp
